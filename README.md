Gambit knows three commands, help, roll, and cointoss.
- -help
- -h

These are both used to print the available commands you can give Gambit.

- -roll xdy

The roll command follows the above format where x is replaced with the amount of dice to roll and y is replaced with the number of sides for the dice.

- -coin
- -cointoss

These commands tell Gambit to flip a coin and return either "Heads!" or "Tails!".
